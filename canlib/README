Package imported from: https://code.google.com/archive/p/pycanlibxl/
It was only partial basic wrapper for Vector XL library built for Python 2.
I've had to make it compatibile with Python 3.5 and also adapt it for changes in newer ctypes.
On top of it it was missing VIRTUAL CAN support,
I've added it with guide of the header files of the original Vector XL library.
